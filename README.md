# photostory

Photo Stories is an app that renders images list. The user should be able to hover each image and get an animation showing additional information. If the user clicks on an image a lightbox should pop up with a full sized image. The application layout should be responsive and should support all type of devices/browsers.

•	Create a JSON file containing all the needed data for the “Photo Story”.
•	Use one of the modern JavaScript frameworks to render the data to the user.
•	Create the stylesheets using a CSS preprocessor.
•	Make sure to support evergreen browsers.

•	Allow reordering of images in a list if user is authenticated. Order parameter does not need to be saved in a JSON file, but would be nice to have.
•	Add search by tags. This means that images should have a list of tags associated to them. It would be nice to see auto completion in search input.

•	Use a task runner like Gulp or Grunt.
•	Use package manager (like Bower) to manage all the JavaScript libraries.
•	Use scaffolding generator like Yeoman or similar.
•	Create an API to provide the JSON containing all the needed data for the “Photo Story
